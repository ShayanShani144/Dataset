Insights & Observations
Vendor Dependence: A major portion of the spend is concentrated with one vendor (SignatureFactory). This may pose a risk if there's over-reliance or lack of competitive sourcing.

Stable Spend Levels: Year-over-year spend shows no major fluctuations, indicating consistent procurement behavior.

No New Vendors: Absence of new vendors suggests either strong existing relationships or a potential gap in vendor sourcing innovation.

Category Spend Distribution: Raw materials dominate spend categories, aligning with manufacturing or production-heavy operations.

Geographic Spend Clustering: Most vendor spend is centered in one region, potentially influencing shipping costs or delivery times.
